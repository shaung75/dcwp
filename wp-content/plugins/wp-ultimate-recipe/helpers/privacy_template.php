When user ratings are enabled we store a WPURP_User_Voted_%recipe% cookie (with %recipe% the ID of the recipe) that contains the rating this user has given to a particular recipe. This cookie is used as (one of the) measures to prevent rating spam.

When the User Menus feature is enabled we store WPURP_Shopping_List_Recipes_v2, WPURP_Shopping_List_Servings_v2 and WPURP_Shopping_List_Order_v2 cookies to be able to show the same shopping list to a guest on later visit. This does not contain any personal data.

When the Meal Planner feature is enabled we store WPURP_Meal_Plan_ID and WPURP_Meal_Plan_ID_%id% cookies to be able to show the same meal plan to a guest on later visit. This does not contain any personal data.
<h3><?php _e( 'IP Address' ); ?></h3>
When user ratings are enabled we store the IP address upon voting. This is used as (one of the) measures to prevent rating spam.
