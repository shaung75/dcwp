<h2>Keep customers happy with back-in-stock notifications</h2>

<p><strong>Automatically notify customers when a product becomes available for purchase</strong></p>
<p>The WooCommerce Waitlist extension lets you track demand for out-of-stock items, making sure your customers feel informed, and therefore more likely to buy.</p>
<p>Using a simple plugin, you can build up a waiting list of people wanting the unavailable item, then notify these customers automatically when products come back in stock.</p>

<h3>Setup in seconds</h3>
<p>It's really easy to install and will instantly start turning those missed opportunities into future sales.</p>
<p>Customers register for an email alert to let them know when a product is back in stock, making it more likely they'll wait and shop with you instead of going to a competitor.</p>
<p>It makes them feel valued by your business, and allows you to replenish stock intelligently based on demand.</p>

<h3>Key features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>allow customers to be notified when they can purchase an item that is currently out-of-stock</li>

<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>It takes just seconds for customers to join a waiting list via a button on the product listing on your WooCommerce store. </p>
<p>As soon as you update your stock numbers on the site, everyone on the list automatically gets an email with a link to the product, making it super-simple for them to buy.</p>
<p>WooCommerce Waitlist fully supports simple products, product variations and the children of grouped products.</p>

<h3>See who's waiting for what</h3>

<p>With WooCommerce Waitlist, shop managers can sort products by the number of customers on their waiting list. This allows them to quickly prioritise which products to re-stock.</p>
<p>Shop managers can also view, manage and contact those on the waiting list for each product directly from the Edit Product screen through a custom product tab. (see left)</p>

<h3>Extend and customise</h3>
<p>The default setup is &lsquo;plug and play&rsquo;, but WooCommerce Waitlist adds a large number of WordPress action and filter hooks allowing you to customise it to suit your exact needs (See <a href="http://wcdocs.woothemes.com/user-guide/extensions/woocommerce-waitlist/#section-11" >documentation</a> for more information). Customisations include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Choosing the wording for notification emails</li>
	<li>Tweaking the design of &lsquo;join waiting list&rsquo; buttons</li>
	<li>Hooking in extra functionality when users are added to/removed from a waiting list</li>
</ul>
